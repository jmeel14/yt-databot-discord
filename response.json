We keep 5 bantam hens in our yard for eggs and entertainment. We live in suburbia in the city of Brisbane, Australia, and the whole yard is their domain and sometimes the house too. One night we heard this incredible noise from the coop every few minutes. I went out to check on the little darlings, half worried it was a snake or some other critter bothering them but it was just Squeak sneezing away. The others didn't seem too bothered but I brought her inside to monitor and possibly take to the vet the next morning.
